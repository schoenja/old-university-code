# Old University Code

This is old code I once wrote for something in uni. Chances are that it's completely useless now.

**IMPORTANT:** This is not meant to be used. See below for the reason why this repo exists.

# What is this?

This is basically based on [this][the-article-thing], I agree that sharing code written for research (or basically everything else uni related) should be shared.
Most of the stuff in this repo will not have any significance, I simply decided that I got to start somewhere, so why not dump all the old, crappy python stuff I wrote...
